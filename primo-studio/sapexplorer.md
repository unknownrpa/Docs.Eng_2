# SAP Inspector

To examine the structure of the SAP Front End interface, Primo Studio includes the SAP Inspector panel. To start working, you should click the "Update the Tree" button ![](<../.gitbook/assets/0 (70).png>). After clicking the button, the inspector will start examining the active application window and display its structure. The left part of the panel shows the control tree.

When a controller is selected, its attributes will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

This information is convenient to use when building SAP Front End element search templates.
