# Log

The Primo Studio and the Primo Robot keep a log of script execution in text files. The log files are located in the Log folder and are named according the "day month year hour\_application name.log" template. A separate file with the same template but with the "custom" additional word in the name is provided for custom log entries. The log is cumulative, i.e. new entries are added to the end of an existing file.
